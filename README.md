Bamazon is a  Amazon-like storefront that takes in orders from customers and depletes stocks from the store's inventory.

Here are some screenshots to give you a rundown of how it works:

First you go to your terminal and type in 'node bamazonCustomer.js'

This will give you a list of the inventory in the store with the products' ID number, name, and price.

Next to the first prompt you will type in the ID number of the product you want to purchase.

A second prompt will then pop up and you will enter the quantity you would like of that product.

If the store has that quantity in stock, the cost of your purchase will be added up for you and a message that your order has been placed will pop up.

In this example you will see a quantity entered that the store does not have in stock.

If this happens you will see an 'Insufficent Quantity' screen pop up that will tell you the store does not have the quantity of that product you entered in stock.
